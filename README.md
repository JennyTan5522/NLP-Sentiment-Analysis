Sentiment analysis is one of the techniques that aims to classify textual data into positive, neutral, and negative labels. The study developed a predictive model that can be used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perform sentiment analysis predictions in various fields. The model will be tested with two different datasets: the COVID test set and the iPhone test set to observe how the models perform in different data patterns and to identify the most suitable sentiment classifier that can correctly classify the sentiment of a sentence. NLTK and TF-IDF models have been used to preprocess the extracted tweets from Kaggle and the Twitter scraps dataset.

Eight classifiers were employed as base learners to evaluate sentiment analysis classification, namely Support Vector Classification (SVC), Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifiers, and Extremely Randomized Trees. Subsequently, ensemble classifiers such as Voting, Bagging, and Stacking were conducted in this experiment. Lastly, deep learning models were also carried out using CNN, RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU. The hybrid ensemble and the deep learning model were also experimented with.

The deep learning model with the best performance is the Stacked RNN-LSTM-GRU with SVM, while the regular machine learning model that performed the best based on the COVID-19 Tweets test data is the Ensemble Bagging model of Random Forest.
